# Translate JSON Dump
Translate your large text files into JSON files.

## version 1.0
- Dump file must be in the same directory (dump.txt).
- An empty output JSON file (output.json) is necessary for this version.

## Finishing the JSON
- You must add open and close brackets ( `[ ` and ` ]` ) to beginning and end of the output file.
- You must search for `}{` and replace all with `},{`

##Â Before you go..
You can always validate your JSON files online.
Here's some validation servies I've found on the internet:

- https://jsonlint.com/

Well Done!
